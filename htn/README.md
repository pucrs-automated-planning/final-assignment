# HTN Planning Projects

## Implementation Requirements

Projects that use classical planning will use: 

- [JSHOP2](https://sourceforge.net/projects/shop/files/JSHOP2/); 
- [SHOP2](https://www.cs.umd.edu/projects/shop/); 
- [PyHop](https://bitbucket.org/dananau/pyhop) or
- Implement your own HTN planner (you will need to implement a parser too)


## Suggested Projects

Students who wish to use HTN planning for their projects may choose not to implement a planner, suggested projects include:

- Exploration of JSHOP2 external calls (using the ``call`` statement) to take advantage of specific solvers.
- Send me your ideas!
