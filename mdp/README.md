# MDP Planning Projects

## Implementation Requirements

Projects that use Markov Decision Processes will use: 

- [pymdptoolkit](https://github.com/sawcordwell/pymdptoolbox); 
- [Octave MDP Toolbox](http://www7.inra.fr/mia/T/MDPtoolbox/); 
- [AIMA Python](http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/python/readme.html) or
