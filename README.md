:checkered_flag: Final assignment structure and documentation

## Overview

The final assignment consists on the implementation of a software that solves a problem in your area of research using the planning techniques studied in this course, namely, one of the following formalisms (follow the links for details):

- [Classical Planning](classical) (here you will need to implement your own planner)
- [HTN Planning](htn)
- [MDP Planning](mdp)
- [Reinforcement Learning](rl) (a special case of MDP)

You will work individually in implementing a planner where appropriate, but also defining your own problem that uses this planner in a way that addresses some research challenge you are facing. 
Your implementation must clearly motivate the reason for the particular formalism choice, which should be described in the final report.

## Grading

The final grade will be composed by the following criteria:

- Implementation
	- Domain complexity (15%)
	- Reasonable modelling of the problem state space (15%)
	- Complexity of the problem to be solved (15%)
	- Appropriateness of the chosen formalism to the problem at hand (15%)
- Report (4 pages, [AAAI Format](http://www.aaai.org/Publications/Templates/AuthorKit.zip))
	- Clarity, organisation and overall logic buildup in the arguments within the report (10%)
	- Problem description (the stuff from your area of research) (15%)
	- Description of the implemented solution (15%)
