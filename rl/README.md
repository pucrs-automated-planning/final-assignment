## Implementation Requirements

Projects that use Reinforcement Learning will use:

- Implement your own MDP solver (you will need to implement a parser too)


## Suggested Projects

Students who wish to use Reinforcement Learning for their projects may choose not to implement a planner, suggested projects include:
