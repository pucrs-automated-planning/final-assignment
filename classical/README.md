# Classical Planning Projects

## Implementation Requirements

Projects that use classical planning will use either: 

- The simple [propositional PDDL](https://github.com/pucrs-automated-planning/pddl-parser) parser supplied by the instructor; or
- for those who want and need a more complex planner, the parser and software included in the [Pyperplan](https://bitbucket.org/malte/pyperplan/) planner


## Suggested Projects

Students who wish to use classical planning for their projects will need to implement the planner themselves (so, will not be able to use any existing planner). 
The implemented planner may be [propositional](https://github.com/pucrs-automated-planning/pddl-parser) (to limit the time spent dealing with unification)

Good choices for classical planning algorithms include:

- [Graphplan](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0004370296000471)
- [Heuristic](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0004370201001084) search (Pyperplan uses this approach)
- [SATisfiability](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/AAAI/1996/AAAI96-177.pdf) testing planning. Note that this may be a harder approach
